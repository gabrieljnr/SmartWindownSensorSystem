# SmartWindownSensorSystem

Windows Automation Project

Hey there! This is a little project I’ve been working on—a simple program in C++ that simulates an automated window system. The idea is to mimic how smart windows might respond to changes in temperature and light, even though I’m just using random values to simulate sensors for now.  

It’s not connected to any real hardware yet, but it’s a step in the direction of building something that could actually control windows in the future.

What It Does

- Generates random temperature (in °C) and light intensity (%) values to simulate sensor readings.  
- Decides when to "open" or "close" the window:
  - If it gets too hot (above 30°C) or bright (light > 70%), the window "opens."  
  - Otherwise, it "closes."  
- You can also override the automatic settings to manually open or close the window.

Why I Built This

I’m just starting out with C++ and wanted to work on something practical to learn more about how logic, conditions, and even random data work in real projects. Plus, I think the idea of smart home automation is pretty cool and something worth exploring!

What’s Next?

-  I’d love to connect it to actual sensors one day, so it can work with live data.  
- Maybe even add some hardware to physically control a window (like motors).  
- Down the road, I’m thinking of adding features like remote control through a mobile app.

It’s a simple start, but I’m excited about where this could go. If you check it out, let me know what you think—I’m always open to feedback!
